# Spring Book

This repo is dedicated to learning Spring 6 using this e-book that 
I found on the Toronto Public Library's website:

*Beginning Spring 6 : From Beginner to Pro* by **Joseph B. Ottinger** and **Andrew Lombardi**

You can probably follow along if you or an institution that you have access to (such as
TPL or the University of Waterloo) has access to O'Reilly Learning

## Getting Started

This repo contains the example files that the ebook uses to demonstrate features of Spring.
Some of these files are exactly the same as what's in the book. Other files may have been
slightly personalized with additional comments, different variable names, and inside jokes.
As such, some of these files aren't easily comprehensable to an outsider, even if these files
are basically functionally identical to the ones you see in the book.


As a warning, some of these inside jokes may lean more towards the mature side of romance,
though there is nothing inappropriate. Otherwise, I wouldn't be hosting this repo here where
potential employers can see my work. Chances are, you probably won't understand these jokes
in the first place, unless you coincidentally play the same video games as me.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Java 17+ and Maven installed. And make sure you have access to the ebook.
